A 2D game created in C using the minilibx library  

<img src="/images/screenshotmap3.png">

## Rules  
Using the minilibx library provided by 42, create a game in which a character navigates a map to pick up collectables and proceed to an exit. 
Images are rendered to a pop up window and actions are triggered by player's keyboard commands (W, A, S, D & ESC).  

## Maps
Maps are made up of 5 characters:  
0 = space  
1 = walls  
P = player  
C = collectables  
E = exit  
The border of the map must be made up of walls, there can only be x1 players and x1 exit. All collectables must be picked up before player can exit the game.  
## Images
All images were created by me in Adobe Photoshop and converted from PNG to XPM files
